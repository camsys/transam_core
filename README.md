# TransAM Core

TransAM is a fully open source software platform for managing transportation assets. As an open
source solution, TransAM provides a low-cost, license-free alternative to proprietary asset management
systems. Specifically designed to address the unique challenges of asset management within public
transportation agencies, the platform is feature rich, including a variety of industry-standard models
to forecast asset condition and replacement cycles, quantify capital needs, and
develop and implement state-of-good-repair policies. TransAM accommodates all types of transportation-related
assets, including rolling stock, rail, facilities, shelters, signage and other infrastructure,
maintenance equipment, communications equipment, and computers and software.

TransAM functionality is decomposed into a set of Rails Engines, which can be incorporated into a Rails application framework 
to build a fully functional TransAM application. The Core engine provides the foundation for all other engines and TransAM applications.
